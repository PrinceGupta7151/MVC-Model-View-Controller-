# ðŸ“Œ MVC (Modelâ€“Viewâ€“Controller) Architecture

- MVC is an architectural design pattern that separates an application into three parts:

- Model â€“ Data and Business Logic

- View â€“ User Interface (UI)

- Controller â€“ Request Handler (middle layer between Model and View)



#  1. Model

ðŸ‘‰ The Model represents the data and business logic of the application.

- Manages database operations (CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Handles data validation
- Contains business rules (e.g., discounts, authentication, etc.)

# 2. View

ðŸ‘‰ The View is what the user sees (UI layer).

- Responsible only for presenting data.

- Can be built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular, EJS, Handlebars, etc.

# 3. Controller

ðŸ‘‰ The Controller handles user requests.

- Processes the request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

- Interacts with the Model to get or update data.

- Passes the data to the View for rendering.



# 4. Flow of MVC

1. User sends a request (Browser â†’ Controller).

2. Controller processes the request and interacts with the Model.

3. Model fetches or updates data from the database.

4. Controller sends the data to the View.

5. View renders the UI with data.

6. User sees the response
